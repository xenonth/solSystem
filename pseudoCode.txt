##Outline

Step 1.
Create each planet as a sphere which rotates around a central point the Sun at scaled down rates using suboptimal engineer's guide.

Additional features:
create a zoom in/out feature which adjusts according to mouse wheel movement

Step 2.
Will need to grab a flat image of each sphere then wrap it to the correct sphereGeometry

Step 3.
Each sphere spin on their axis at the correct rates

Due to increased complexity of this project will attempt to modulate the planetary Sphere and call it into Main.JS

Future updates once mastered:
If still interested and time allows, add html information that displays when each object is hovered over.
